| Programmers Name: Prof. Foos
| Course:           CS-212: Data Structures for Engineers
| Program  Name:    Simulation with queues
| Date:             12/22/2022
|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Program Description:
|   This program will simulate two lines at a store, each line will be a queue.
|   (The type of store is not important)
|
|   If both lines (the queues) are full the customer will leave angry.
|
|   If one of the lines (the queues) are not full the new customer will be placed in the line.
|
|   When a customer is at the front of line (the queue), the customer will start the process
|   of being checked out. When the process has completed, the customer be removed from the line.
|
|   Debugging Information: 
|   -----------------------
|    Look at the top of Simulation.c and you will find a macro called DEBUG. 
|   If this macro is uncommented, debug information will be printed to DebuggingData.txt. 
|   If this macro is left commented out, no information will be printed to the file. 
|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Inputs:
|   The following inputs to control the simulation are macros defined in Inputs.h:
|
|      ***************************************************************
|      *   SIMULATION CONTROL MACROS                                 *
|      ***************************************************************
|
|   SECONDS_FOR_PROGRAM_TO_RUN
|    The numbers seconds that your simulation will run for
|
|   MAX_QUEUE_SIZE
|    The max size of a line for the customers to stand in.
|
|      ***************************************************************
|      *   THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN POSSIBLE CUSTOMER CREATESION   *
|      ***************************************************************
|
|	SECONDS_BEFORE_A_NEW_TIME_IS_CALCULATED
|    Every so many seconds, a new customer may be created. This time is a random number 
|  that is re-generated every so many seconds. This macro is the number of seconds between
|  re-generations of the time needed before a new customer may be created. 
|   	
|   DEFAULT_TIME_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|    The default time between possible customer creations. 
|
|    Formula to create new time: 
|    ((Random Number % TIME_SPAN_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER) / 10) + MIN_TIME_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|
|   MIN_TIME_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|     This is the minimum number of seconds that will pass between calculations.    
|
|   TIME_SPAN_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|     This is the span (max - min) between possible calculation. 
|
|      ***************************************************************
|      *   THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO CEHCK A CUSTOMER OUT         *
|      ***************************************************************
|
|    Formula to create the amount of time needed to check a customer out:
|    (Random Number % TIME_SPAN_TO_PROCESS_CUSTOMER) + MIN_TIME_TO_PROCESS_CUSTOMER 
|    
|   MIN_TIME_TO_PROCESS_CUSTOMER
|      This is the minimum number of seconds that will are needed to check a customer out.
|
|   TIME_SPAN_TO_PROCESS_CUSTOMER
|      This is the span (max - min) between possible times
|
|      ***************************************************************
|      *   THE PROBABILITY THAT NEW CUSTOMER IS CREATED              *
|      ***************************************************************
|
|   SECONDS_BEFORE_A_NEW_PERCENTAGE
|     The amount of time before a new percentage is generated
|
|   DEFAULT_PERCENTAGE_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|     The percentage chance that a new customer will be created before the 
|    the first new percentage calculation is made
|
|    Formula to create a new percentage:
|    (Random Number % PERCENTAGE_SPAN_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER) + MIN_PERCENTAGE_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|
|    MIN_PERCENTAGE_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|      This is the minimum probability that a new customer will be created.
|
|    PERCENTAGE_SPAN_TO_CREATE_CUSTOMER
|      This is the span (max - min) between possible percentages.
|   
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Processing:
|   The main function will do 4 tasks:
|
|     1)  Possibly create a new customer (if it's time)
|     2)  If the customer is created, the customer will either be placed into a queue or the
|         the customer will leave angry (because the queue is full).
|     3)  If a customer is at the front of the line, that customer will begin the checkout process
|     4)  Stats will be printed to the screen
|
|   The following information will be recorded:
|
|     1) Number of customers served
|     2) Number of customers that leave early
|     3) total time spent in line
|     4) total time serving a customer
|
|   The following information will be calculated:
|     1) The average time spent in line
|     2) The average time spent checking out
|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Outputs:
|   The following stats will printed to the screen at the end of every frame:
|     1) Number of people in line A
|     2) Number of people in line B
|     3) Total number of angry customers
|     4) Total number of customers served
|     5) Total number of customers
|     6) Average time to check out a customer
|     7) Average time spent in line
|
|   The following information will printed to an out file. 
|     - An integer code that contains the following information:
|       1) The identification number of the customer
|       2) Customer status (either angry or checked out)
|       3) The time the person was created
|       4A) The rating for the store (if they were checked out)
|       4B) Their opinion of the store if they left angry.
